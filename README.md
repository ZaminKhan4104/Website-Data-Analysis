## 📊 Executive Summary

This notebook explores traffic trends and user engagement across multiple dimensions. The key findings are:

### 1. Sessions and Users Over Time
- Traffic consistently spikes during late afternoon (3 PM to 5 PM) and late evening (9 PM to 11 PM).
- These hours represent nearly one-third of the entire session activity.
- ✅ **Suggestion:** Schedule campaigns and posts during these active hours for better visibility.

### 2. User Distribution by Channel
- The majority of users arrive through **Organic Search** and **Direct** sources.
- **Referral**, **Email**, and **Social** bring smaller but significant traffic.
- ✅ **Suggestion:** Invest more in high-performing channels while improving targeting for low-traffic sources.

### 3. Engagement Time by Channel
- **Email** and **Referral** channels showed the longest average engagement time per session.
- **Direct** and **Social** channels had shorter average session durations.
- ✅ **Suggestion:** Improve content or targeting in weaker channels using lessons from higher-performing ones.

### 4. Engaged vs Non-Engaged Sessions
- **Referral** and **Email** had a high number of engaged sessions relative to total sessions.
- **Social** had more non-engaged sessions, indicating possible mismatch in user intent.
- ✅ **Suggestion:** Enhance landing page design, content relevance, and speed for channels with low engagement.

### 5. Channel Activity by Hour
- **Organic Search** drives traffic mostly in the afternoon.
- **Email** performs better during nighttime.
- ✅ **Suggestion:** Align marketing content and ads with the most active time blocks per channel.
